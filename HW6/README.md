### Given a list of numbers and the index of an element in the list k. Remove the element with index k from the list by moving all elements to the right of the element with index k to the left.
``` 
shift_directly_in_list.py - program shifts all the elements, and then removes the last element of the list using the pop () method without parameters
```
### Given a list of integers (can be generated using a random number generator), a number k and a value C. It is necessary to insert into the list at the position with the index k the value C, shifting all the elements with the index greater than k to the right. Since this increases the number of elements in the list, you will need to add a new element (any value) to the end of the list using the append () method.
``` 
shift_all_elements_to_the_right.py - program inserts the value C into the list at index k, shifting all elements with index greater than k to the right
```
### Given two lists of numbers (can be generated using a random number generator). Count how many unique numbers are simultaneously in both the first list and the second.
``` 
numbers_both_the_first_and_second_list.py - program counts how many unique numbers are contained simultaneously both in the first list and in the second
```
